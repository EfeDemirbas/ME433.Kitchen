## Stuffed Zucchini Blossoms
<!---

This is a great vegan appetizer for a summer picnic! Zucchini blossoms are very delicate and open up early in the morning, so it is best to prepare this dish right after the harvest. 

### Ingredients
- 20 zucchini blossoms
- 1 cup rice 
- 1/2 large onion 
- 1 clove garlic
- 2 tomatoes 
- 1/2 bunch parsley
- Lemon for decoration
- Olive oil
- Salt
- Black pepper
- A pinch of cumin 

### Instructions
1. Wash the blossoms individually and remove the parts that you don't want to eat: stem, outer green leaves, inner pistil and stamen by using a knife or a tweezer. 
2. Rinse them once again and set aside to drain thoroughly. 
3. Boil 2 cups of water and pour over the rice. Let it release the starch for couple of minutes. Then, rinse it under cold running water. 
4. While waiting for the rice, grate onion, garlic and tomatoes, and finely chop parsley.
5. In a shallow sauce pan, heat the olive oil. Add onion, garlic and rice and stir continuously over medium heat. 
6. Take the saucepan from the heat and add other ingredients. 
7. Carefully fill each blossom and fold the open ends inward. 
8. Place the blossoms in a wide pot and add 1 cup of water and some olive oil. Bring to a boil and cook for 25-30 minutes.
9. Remove them from the pot, and let it cool to room temperate. 
10. Finish the plating with a drizzle of olive oil and lemon slices.

Enjoy!
