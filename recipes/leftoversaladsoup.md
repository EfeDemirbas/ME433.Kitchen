## Lizzie's Leftover Salad Soup Recipe (really just a modified and healthy potato soup)
The soup is better than the name would indicate. It kind of mimics a traditional Irish veg stew, but without turnips. 
I never make my way through all of my leafy greens, so when I find the arugula
or spinach is about to expire, I make this veggie soup that I can puree the greens into! 
Sry for lack of clear measurements

### Ingredients
- Leafy greens: Use whatever is about to expire and you need to get rid of. Arugula, spinach, lettuce, kale, it all works.
- Garlic: If using raw garlic, I like to use 2-3 cloves. If using pre-minced garlic, maybe 1-2 tsp
- Onion, shallot, green onion, leek: What do you have in your kitchen? Use it. Doesn't matter how much, just adjust veg broth and 
    potato ratios accordingly
- Potatoes: At least a cup. Don't need to skin. Just cut into smallish pieces, like 1 cubic inch maybe. 
- Vegetable broth: If you're using ~2 cups of onions/leeks/whatever and potatoes, then a carton (4 cups) of broth should suffice. If you 
    don't have enough broth, you can use water and salt the crap out of this bad boy.
- Coriander: A lot?? I like coriander, so I just pour it in. Just do to taste. 
- Black pepper: Also a lot? I like when there's a little bite to the soup from the pep
- Salt: Depends what broth you use. Probably a fair bit?
- Oil: I use olive or avocado. Prob need 2 Tbsp to heat up onion/garlic mixture.


### Instructions
1. Heat the oil in a soup pot (should be a few quarts big I think)
2. Add in chopped garlic and onion/shallot/leek/whatever. Season with salt, pepper, coriander. Saute for a few mins. 
3. Add potatoes, vegetable broth (and/or water) (You're going to be pureeing everything so just add as much as you 
    think you want the consistency to be after pureeing. Always easier to air on side of not liquidy enough, because 
    you can easily add water after you puree the first time, but you may not have any more potatoes to thicken it up)
4. Add leafy greens. Stir these buggers into the broth until they start to wilt and cook. 
5. Cook until potatoes are soft.
6. Puree. Use a food processor or emulsifier. 
7. Modify as needed (is it too thick? add more broth or water). Prob need to add a lot more salt, pepper, and coriander. 
    I swear, don't be shy with coriander, it's soooo good.
8. Serve, put in fridge, or freeze - freezes super well which is why I love this recipe because I don't have to feel
    guilty about letting anything go to waste
    
*In the past, I have added butter to this recipe. I haven't noticed much of a difference. But I imagine you could make
this more like a traditional potato-leek soup if you add cream and butter.
