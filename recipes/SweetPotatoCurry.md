I eat this every week and really like it.

### Ingredients
- 1/2 pound sweet potatoes (about 1 medium) peeled and chopped into 3 cm pieces
- 1/4 tbsp oil or water (if oil-free)
- 1/4 medium (100 g) onion chopped
- 1-2 garlic cloves minced
- 1- inch (5 cm) fresh ginger minced
- 1/4 tbsp curry powder
- 1/2 tsp ground turmeric
- 1/2 tsp ground cumin
- 1/2 tsp salt or less/more to taste
- 1/4 tsp smoked paprika
- 1/4 tsp ground ginger
- 2/3 cup coconut milk 
- 1/2 cup passata (tomato sauce)
- 1/2 15 oz can of chickpeas rinsed and drained (optional)


### Instructions
1. Heat oil in a pot over medium heat and add the onion. Sauté for about 3 minutes.
2. Stir in garlic and fresh ginger and sauté for a further 1 minute. Add spices and stir again.
3. Next, add the passata, the sweet potato chunks, and the coconut milk.
4. Give it another stir, and bring to a boil. Let simmer on low heat for about 10-15 minutes or until the sweet potato chunks are fork tender and the curry thickened. Now add the cooked chickpeas for additional protein.
5. Serve over rice of choice or with naan bread.


# Yum!
