### Ingredients (serves 2)
- Oriental style noodles
- Cooking oil
- Olive oil
- Morton salt
- 1 bunch of bok choi
- 3-4 white mushrooms
- Braised pork (refridgerated)
- Soy sauce
- Chinese vinegar

### Instructions
1. Throroughly wash and cut bok choi and mushrooms.
1. Fill a cooking pot with 1/2L cold tap water and bring the water to a boil. Add cooking oil and a pinch of salt.
2. While waiting for the water to boil, measure out around 70-90g of oriental noodles (the amount depends on how much you normally eat).
3. Once the water is boiling, set the heat to medium and put noodles into the pot. Use chopsticks, or something like a ladle, to stir the noodles.
4. After around 1 minute, add both the bok choi and mushrooms into the pot. Stir occasionally.
5. Add soy sauce and a little bit of chinese vinegar into the pot. The color of the water should change to be slightly brownish, but not dark brown.
6. After letting the water boil for a bit, add the braised pork into the pot, and wait for the water to boil again. 
7. Taste the noodles occasionally and ensure that they aren't undercooked. 
8. Turn off the stove and serve the noodles!
