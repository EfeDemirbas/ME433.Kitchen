I really adore good hummus and store bough hummus just doesn't compare! Therefore I ventured out to make some fresh hummus at home.

### Ingredients
- 1 15 oz. can of chickpeas
- 1 lemon worth of fresh lemon juice
- 1/4 cup tahini (store bought or home made!)
- 1 clove of garlic minced or mashed
- 2 tablespoons of olive oil
- 1/2 teaspoon ground cumin
- several teaspoons of water (to fine tune the consistancy)
- salt to taste


### Instructions
1. Blend tahini and lemon juice in a food processor until well mixed (about 2 minutes).
2. Add garlic, oil, and cumin to food processor and again blend until well mixed.
3. Gradually mix chickpeas into foodprocessor. The hummus will become very thick.
4. Add water in small increments, scraping foodprocessor sides and blending until desired consistancy is reached.
5. Salt to taste.

Fresh hummus oxidezes very qucikly, so it is best to use it quickly and store it in an air tight container.
Enjoy!
