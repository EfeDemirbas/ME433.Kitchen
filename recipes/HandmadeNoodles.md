## Lin's Handmade Noodles
My dad makes really good Chinese handmade noodles and I thought I would share! This style has the noodles served with a simple sauce. We don't typically use measurement tools so these are all rough guesses...

### Ingredients
- 2 cups all purpose flour
- 1/2 cup water 
- 1/4 cup vegetable oil 
- 2 tablespoons soy sauce 
- 1 tablespoon Sichuan peppercorn (don't eat these, they'll numb your mouth)
- 2 whole dried red pepper (can exclude if you don't like spicy foods)
- onion powder, garlic powder, and pepper to taste

### Instructions
### Part 1: Making the Noodles
1. Pour the flour into a mixing bowl 
2. Slowly add the water while kneading it into the flour. Keep kneading until the mixture becomes dough that doesn't stick to the hand when touched. Add more water if the dough cracks and flakes. Add more flour if the dough sticks to the hand. 
3. Cover the dough with either a wet paper towel or a lid to prevent moisture loss and let sit for at least 2 hours, ideally 3-4 hours. 
4. Cover a cutting board or clean countertop with flour and put the dough onto the surface
5. Flatten the dough using a rolling pin to a rectangular shape that is approximately 1cm thick 
6. Use a knife or pizza cutter to cut the rectangle into strips of desired noodle width and length (I recommend approximately 0.75in wide and 4-5in long)
7. Boil water in a pot 
8. Lightly and gently stretch the noodles to increase their length before tossing them in the pot. Noodles should have increased their length to approximately 1.5x their original length 
9. Boil noodles for approximately 14 minutes or until they are fully cooked and not mushy 
10. Put noodles in bowl and drain the water

### Part 2: Making the sauce
1. Put the vegetable oil in a saucepan and put on medium heat
2. Put in the soy sauce, Sichuan peppercorn, peppers, and spices 
3. Mix for approximately 5 minutes and then turn off the heat
4. You can add onions and/or japalenos to the sauce as well 
5. Drizzle sauce over the noodles 


Enjoy!
