## Junior’s Ramen and Hot Dogs
<!---

-->
I’m not going to lie this is pretty simple, but if you have the spicy ramen, it’s definitely a hit.

### Ingredients
- 2 cups of water
- Spicy Ramen
- Hot Dogs



### Instructions
1. Turn stove on, put on high.
2. Boil water on stove. 
3. Cut up hot dogs, put in boiling water and wait until the pieces of hot dog float.
4. Add spice and vegetable packets, and wait for water to begin boiling again.
5. Add ramen noodles, and taste till they’re soft enough. 

Enjoy!
