My favorite mexican dish that I love to make but it takes a very long time so I dont make it often. Some of these ingredients can be difficult to find if you are in a very not diverse area/dont know where to shop.
Can be made for ton or a little bit of people.
Prep Time: About 3 hours

### Ingredients
- 2 lbs of carne maciza (Pork stew in english(?))
- 1.5 lbs of carne espinazo, should have bones (Pork spine in English I think) 
- 1 Large can of white hominy 
- 2 Dried California Chiles
- 3 Dried Guajillo Chiles
- 1 Dried Pasilla Ancho Chiles
- 3 Cloves of Garlic
- 1 Onion
- 1 Large Tomato
- Salt
- Bag of Tostadas
- Lime for topping
- Cabbage for topping
- Raddishes for topping

### Instructions
1. Rinse all your pork meat and cut the onion and tomato into fourths
2. Place all the pork and onion into a really large pot with a lot of extra water and set to boil for 1.5-2 hours. Salt the water
3. Remove stem and dessed the chiles as best you can and set to soak while the meat cooks
4. About 30 mins into the meat cooking, blend the chiles and the garlic and sift into the large pot of meat
5. Add tomato to the pot
6. Once the meat is soft, rinse hominy, add to pot and let cook for another 30-45 minutes

Serve into large bowl, top with cabbage/radishes/lemon and have tostadas on the side
Enjoy!
