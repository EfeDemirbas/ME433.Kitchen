Kuih Bahulu is a traditional Malaysian sponge cake commonly eaten over Chinese New Year. Its typical shape requires a special bahulu mold, but it is not necessary. Serves 4.

### Ingredients
- 3 eggs
- 1 cup sugar
- 1 1/4 cup flour, sifted
- 1 teaspoon vanilla essense
- 1/4 teaspoon baking soda

### Instructions
1. Preheat oven to 375F. Grease bahulu mold (or regular baking pan).
2. Beat the eggs until frothy and add the sugar after. Continue to beat the mixture until it becomes sticky.
3. Add the vanilla essense and fold in the flour gradually.
4. Once well blended, fill the bahulu mold (or spoon desired circle size droplets to the pan)
5. Bake for 15 minutes till light brown.

Enjoy!
