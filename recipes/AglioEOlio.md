For the past six months, my roommates and I have survived purely on pasta and espresso. When we're sick of red sauce and pesto but still have several kilos of spaghetti left, "Aglio e Olio", spaghetti with garlic and olive oil, is our go-to! 

### Ingredients (serves 2)
- 2 cloves of garlic
- 1/2 cup parsely, finely chopped
- 1/2 cup olive oil
- 1 tsp red pepper flakes
- two servings of spaghetti
- salt and pepper to taste
- grated parmesian to preference

### Instructions
1. Fill a large pot with cold tap water and bring to boil (cold tap water is cleaner than warm tap water).
2. While waiting for boil, slice two cloves of garlic then crush with flat edge of knife.
3. Add olive oil to a pan and set to low heat.
4. Once pot of water is boiling, add three Tbs of salt, stir well, then add two servings of spaghetti. Stir for 9 minutes or until al dente.
5. Add garlic to pan and raise heat to medium. Stir garlic until the edges turn golden, then set heat to low.
6. Once spaghetti is ready, strain from boiling water then add to pan. Set pan heat back to medium.
7. Add red pepper flakes to pan and stir for 1 minute.
8. Serve, adding chopped parsely, grated parmesian, salt, and pepper to preference.

Enjoy! And please don't leave your dishes in the sink :)
