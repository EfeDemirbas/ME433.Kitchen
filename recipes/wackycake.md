## Daelan's Chocolate Wacky Cake
<!---
R Daelan Roosa, rdroosa

This is my family's standard cake for birthdays, other holidays, or just because we're hungry. It's quick, dangerously simple, and keeps really well in Tupperware containers. 

### Ingredients
- 3 cups flour
- 6 Tablespoons cocoa powder
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 2 teaspoons baking soda
- 2 cups sugar
- 3/4 cup vegetable oil (or other shortening)
- 2 tablespoons vinegar or lemon juice
- 2 cups cold water
- 2 cups bittersweet chocolate chips

### Instructions
1. Preheat oven to 350F, and grease a 9x13 pan.
2. In a large bowl, mix the flour, sugar, salt, cocoa powder, and baking soda.
3. In a separate bowl, combine the water, shortening, and lemon juice or vinegar.
4. Mix the wet and dry ingredients thoroughly to form a batter.
5. Pour the batter into the pan, and bake at 350F for 20-25 minutes, or until cooked through.
6. Remove the cake from the oven. While the cake is still hot, sprinkle the bittersweet chocolate across the top of the cake. When it melts, gently spread it with a knife to evenly cover the surface of the cake.
7. Wait 20 minutes for the cake to cool.
8. (Optional) Serve with a scoop of vanilla ice cream.

Enjoy!
