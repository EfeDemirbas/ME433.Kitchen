## Godson's Mac and Cheese

I love cooking but I love taking my time with it. Problem is I don't got that much time these days. When I do though, mac and cheese is where it's at. Shout out to my friend, Sciaska, for teaching me this.

> Disclaimer: I don't really measure when I cook. The amounts come from the soul but I have some ball parks I tell folks when I explain recipes. I would try to stay around the ball parks if you don't feel your soul guiding you.


#### Ingredients

*   1 lb. dried elbow pasta
*   1/2 cup unsalted butter
*   1 cup of chicken broth
*   1 1/2 cups whole milk
*   2 1/2 cups heavy whipping cream
*   1/2 Tbsp garlic & herbs seasoning
*   3 cups shredded sharp cheddar cheese
*   1 cup shredded italian style cheese
*   1 cup shredded colby & monterey jack cheese
*   1 cup shredded mozzarella cheese
*   1/2 Tbsp. salt
*   1/2 tsp. black pepper
*   1/2 Tbsp. old bay seasoning
*   1/4 tsp. paprika
*   1 Tbsp of Sour Cream
*   1 Tbsp of Cream Cheese
*   2 eggs



##### Instructions

> Feel free to freestyle a bit on seasoning. You know your taste best. Don't go crazy though

1.  Preheat oven to 325 degrees F and grease a 3 qt baking dish (9x13") with the butter. Set aside.
2.  Boil the pasta in salted water and chicken broth. Drain and drizzle with a little bit of olive oil to keep from sticking.
3.  Put the pasta in the greased pan.
4.  Mix in cheeses, sour cream and cream cheese with the pasta in the pan very well. _Your hands (washed of course) are probably your best friend at this step_.

>   If you got some pan seared shrimp or bacon bits you wanted to add in, you should mix that in now. I encourage you to actually. That stuff hits.

5.  Whisk up the eggs, heavy whipping cream, black pepper, paprika, old bay seasoning as well as the garlic and herbs seasoning.
6.  Pour the mixture into the pan until its about half the height of the mac and cheese.
7.  Bake with the pan covered by aluminum foil until the liquid is just about gone.
8.  For the last 5 minutes in the oven, take off the aluminum foil to get a crust on top.


I'm going to encourage freestyling one more time down here. Enjoy the process and hope you enjoy the food.
