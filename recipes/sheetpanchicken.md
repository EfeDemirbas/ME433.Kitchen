Here's an interesting looking sheet pan olive bar chicken recipe I found on the Internet, I haven't tried making this so taste is not guaranteed.

### Ingredients
- Fingerling potatoes
- Olive oil
- Boneless, skinless chicken thighs
- Lemon
- Red onion
- Everything you love most from the olive bar
- Garlic powder

### Instructions
1. Chop up the onion, lemon and potatoes (no, you donâ€™t need to peel them).
2. Pop the potatoes into the oven (dressed with a little oil, salt & pepper) to get a jump on roasting, since they take a little longer than everything else.
3. **15** minutes later, add the chicken, olive bar ingredients, lemon, onion and a little more salt, pepper, garlic powder and oil to the pan, and let it all continue cooking.
4. **35** minutes later, dinner is done!

# Enjoy!
