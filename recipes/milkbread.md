This recipe produces a soft, chewy, and rich bread. Takes a while, too, so it'll help pass the time in this slightly dull period. 

### Ingredients
-STARTER
	-1/4 tablespoon bread flour
	-1/4 cup whole milk
	-1/4 cup water
-DOUGH
	-2 1/2 cup bread flour
	-1/4 cup granulated sugar
	-2 1/4 teaspoons active dry yeast, 1 yeast packet
	-1 tablespoon dry milk powder or sweetened condensed milk
	-1 teaspoon salt
	-1/2 cup milk, room temperature
	-1 egg, room temperature and beaten
	-1/4 cup unsalted butter, softened
	-Heavy cream or melted butter

### Instructions
1. In a small saucepan over medium heat, combined the ingredients for the starter.  Stir continuously for 4-5 minutes or until the starter thickens to the consistency of mashed potatoes.  Transfer to a bowl and cover with plastic wrap.  Let sit until the starter gets to room temperature.
2. In the bowl of a stand mixer, whisk together bread flour, sugar, yeast, dry milk powder, and salt.  Once mixed, add in milk, starter, and beaten egg.  Using the dough hook attachment, beat on low for 5 minutes.  Add in butter and beat 5 more minutes.  Turn the speed up to medium and beat for a final 5 minutes.  Transfer dough to a lightly oiled bowl and cover with plastic wrap.  Let sit for 1 hour or until the dough has doubled in size.
3. Transfer dough onto a lightly floured surface and divide into 4 equally sized pieces.  Roll each out to be 8"x5" and then fold each of the long sides in 1".  Starting on one of the shorter edges, roll up and then place in a greased 9"x4" pan.  Repeat with each piece of dough.  Cover and let rise an additional 45 minutes.
4. Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Once the dough has risen, brush the top of the dough with heavy whipping cream.  Place into oven and bake for 35-40 minutes or until the top is golden brown and the inside is 190 degrees.
5.Remove from oven and let sit 5 minutes before removing bread from pan.  Let cool on a cooling rack.

Enjoy!
