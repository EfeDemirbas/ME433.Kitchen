## Nithin's milk cake
<!---
Name: Nithin Gunamgari
-->
I'm fond of sweets and milk cake is one of the easiest ones to make at home. This is a popular sweet of India and all you need are milk, sugar and clarified butter.

### Ingredients
- 2 litres of milk
- 3 tbsp of clarified butter
- 300 grams of sugar
- pinch of lime salt
- 1/2 tbsp of cardamom powder

### Instructions
1. Heat up a stainless pan on high heat.
2. Add the milk and start boiling it
3. Make sure that you're continuously stirring the milk to prevent the milk from sticking to the bottom
4. Keep stirring till the milk gets reduced to half the quantity.
5. Add a pinch of crushed lime salt. This creates minute acidic lumps of milk along with fatty milk solids.
6. Keep stirring till you have smooth consistency. Add sugar in small batches to retain the consistency.
7. Add clarified butter in bathces and keep on stirring till you can see the color of the milk change to golden yellow.
8. Take a cake mould and grease it with butter. Pour the cooked milk into the mould and cover it with a thick towel to contain the heat.
9. After 3-4 hours, take the cake out and cut it into pieces. There you go! 

Enjoy!
