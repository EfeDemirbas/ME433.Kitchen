- 1 1/2 cups water
- oil for deep frying

2. Add salt, ground corriander, and diced lemongrass to the bowl of water and mix to create a marinade
4. Cut tofu into bite-sized cubes
5. Add tofu to a container and layer with marinade
6. Cover container and set aside in refrigerator for 1-3 days

10. Place small batches of tofu gently into the wok
11. Fry until golden, separating the tofu to fry evenly
