A simple, quick morning meal that works perfect for groups who wake up one-by-one as they smell what their roommates are cooking and want in. Also works with bagels instead of toast!

### Ingredients (serves 1)
- 2 pieces of bread (white or brown)
- 2 eggs
- 2 TBSP of butter
- Ground black pepper
- Jelly / Nutella / Peanut butter / toast topping of choice

### Useful tools
- Griddle or pan wide enough for two/three slices of bread
- A cookie cutter or glass with sharp-ish edge
- A spatula for flipping bread

### Instructions
1. Bring griddle or pan to high heat. Once heated, slick surface with butter.
2. While heating, using cutter or glass, cut out a closed hole in each slice of bread. Keep removed portion of bread. Note: Slice of bread must remain closed or egg will spill!
3. Place bread cutouts and bread slices onto the buttered surface. Keep current side facing down until it reaches toast-extent of preference.
3. Once properly toasted, flip all pieces of bread. Place a small portion of fresh butter into the hole of bread slices, then crack one egg into each bread slice. Grind black pepper onto each egg immediatedly after cracking.
4. Allow egg-in-a-basket to remain on hot surface until 30 seconds after a liquid-tight seal has formed between the egg and the surface-side of the bread. Then, flip over the bread slices and remove the bread cutouts.
5. Allow egg-in-a-basket to remain on hot surface for another 30 seconds before serving.
6. Serve, adding toast topping of choice to bread cutouts.

Enjoy! This will take practice - ideally, when you cut into the egg-in-a-basket, the egg's yolk should be runny. It is very easy to overcook the egg, but even solid egg-in-a-basket tastes great!
