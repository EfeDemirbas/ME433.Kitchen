Lava Cake is great because it has both of both worlds: a great bready texture with intense molten chocolate. There are versions with ganache out there, but if you're a bit lazy, like me, than you can make this no ganache version. 

### Ingredients
- 1/2 cup unsalted butter 
- 165g 60% cacao chocolate (or darker if you prefer) 
- 2 eggs
- 2 egg yolks
- 2 tsp vanilla extract
- 3 Tbsp granulated sugar
- 1.5 Tbsp brown sugar
- 1/2 tsp fine sea salt
- 2 Tbsp all purpose flour

### Instructions
1. Preheat oven to 450F. 
2. Grease ramekins with butter and dust it with flower
3. Melt the chocolate and butter over a double boiler. 
3. In a separate bowl, beat the eggs and egg yolks together until doubled in volume. 
4. Stir the egg mixture while adding in brown sugar, granulated sugar, fine sea salt, and vanilla extract. 
5. Add the chocolate to the egg mixture and fold until combined. 
6. Add in the flour and fold until combined. 
7. Pour the batter into the ramekins and place them into the oven for approximately 10 minutes. 
8. Remove the ramekins and invert them over a plate to serve. 
9. If you want, you can dust powdered sugar on top and serve with ice cream.
