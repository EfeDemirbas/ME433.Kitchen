## Nick's Instant Pot Beef Stew
I use my pressure cooker a few times a week. It gives you that slow cooked meal flavor with dump everything in and ignore effort.

### Ingredients
- 1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil
- 6 strips bacon
- 3 lbs beef chuck or stewing beef
- 6 cloves garlic
- salt and pepper to taste
- 3 cups red wine, Merlot or Pinot Noir
- handful of baby carrots
- 1 large onion
- 3 cups beef stock
- 1 small can tomato paste
- 1 package baby bella mushrooms

### Instructions
1. Brown the beef in a pan. It doesn't have to cook all the way, just enoguh to give it some of that browned flavor.
2. Cook the bacon in a pan, draining the fat. Chop into 1/2 inch chunks.
3. Chop the garlic, carrots, onion, and mushrooms.
4. Add all ingrdients to the Instant Pot, and run using the Meat / Stew setting.

Mashed or broiled potatoes make a great side.

Enjoy!
