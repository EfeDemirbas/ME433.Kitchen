## Chase Correia's Caramelized Pork Bowl Stir Fry 

Inspired from vietnamese rice bowls, this dish is quick and easy to make if youre in the mood for something sweet and savory. 

### Ingredients

*   1 1/2 tbsp cooking oil (I use canola oil)
*   1/2 onion , finely diced (brown, white or yellow) (~1/2 cup)
*   2 tsp ginger , grated or minced
*   2 garlic cloves , minced (2 tsp paste)
*   1 tsp Thai chili , deseeded/ finely chopped   (red pepper works okay too)
*   1 lb / 500g ground pork (mince) (Note 2)
*   5 tbsp brown sugar
*   2 tbsp fish sauce (oyster sauce works too)

### Instructions

1.  Heat the oil in a large skillet over high heat.
2. Add the onion, ginger, garlic and chili and cook for 2 minutes.
3. Add the pork mince and cook for 2 minutes or so until white all over, breaking up the meat with a wooden spoon.
4. Add the sugar and fish sauce. Stir, then leave it to cook without touching until all the juices cook out and the pork starts caramelised - about 2 minutes. Then stir it and leave it again, without stirring, for around 30 seconds to get more caramelisation. Repeat twice more until caramelised to your taste.
5. Serve over rice or vermicelli noodles, garnished with sliced scallions/shallots. For a low carb, low cal option, try Cauliflower Rice! I like to have chunks of plain cucumber and carrots on the side which is a classic way of making Vietnamese bowls.

Enjoy!
