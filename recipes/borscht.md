This is a delicious borscht recipe that's vegan and free of most allergens. It's based off one I found online, but since then, I've modified it and made it my own. I love to enjoy it on a cold day with a chunk of rye bread.

Serves about 10

### Ingredients
- 3 beets, grated
- 3 russet potatoes, quartered and sliced
- ¼ head cabbage, grated
- 2 carrots, thinly sliced
- 1 medium onion, chopped
- 1 small bell pepper, chopped
- 4 tbsp oil
- 3 tbsp tomato sauce
- 1 cup dried northern beans, soaked and boiled
- 4 cups vegetable stock (I use bouillon cubes)
- 2 bay leaves
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 3-4 tbsp vinegar
- 6 cups water
- Salt, black pepper, red pepper, and vegeta to taste
- Sour cream and dill for garnish (optional)

### Instructions
1. Grate, slice, chop all vegetables.
2. Add 2 tbsp oil to a large soup pot over medium-high heat. Sauté beets for ~10 minutes or until soft, stirring occasionally.
3. Add stock, water, potatoes, cabbage, carrots and bay leaves. Cook ~10-15 minutes, or until the potato is easily pierced with a fork.
4. Meanwhile, add the remaining 2 tbsp oil to a large skillet over medium-high heat. Sauté pepper and onion, stirring occasionally, until softened. Add tomato sauce, fry and stir for 30 seconds, then add mixture to the pot.
5. Once potatoes and carrots are cooked, add beans with their water, vinegar, and garlic. Season to taste and let cook another 10-25 minutes.
6. Serve with sour cream and dill (optional).

Enjoy!
