## Kailey's "Messy Spaghetti"
Here's my mom's take on the classic "what random things can we throw into this spaghetti" dish. Child me would be disgusted, but then again child me used to eat spaghetti with ketchup, so what do they know. 

### Ingredients
- Minced Garlic
- Olive oil
- 8 oz of Freshly Shredded Parmesan
- 4-6 Eggs
- 1 Box of Spaghetti
- 1 Package of Bacon
- 1 Bag of Frozen Peas

### Instructions
1. Preheat oven to 350F. Use olive oil it coat a 10in x 8in pan.
2. Place eggs in a pot, fill with water and hardboil eggs until the yolks are firm (usually around 10 minutes on heat). 
3. Once the eggs are cooked, place them in an ice bath to cool. 
4. In a pan, cook the entire package of bacon to desired crispiness.
5. In a microwave, heat up the frozen peas. 
6. Fill a large pot with water and cook spaghetti until al dente. NOTE: This step is important. You will be adding the pasta to the oven to finish cooking.
7. Strain pasta and place into the 10in x 8in pan. 
8. Cut / break hard boiled eggs into small pieces, about 1/2in wide. 
9. Crumble cooked bacon. 
10. Add chopped egg, crumbled bacon, peas, shredded parmesan, a couple splashes of olive oil, and as much garlic as you like to the pan with the spaghetti. 
11. Combine until ingredients are evenly distributed amongst the spaghetti. 
12. Place plan in the oven for about 20 minutes, until the cheese has melted.

Enjoy!
