## Chapaguri for Plebs
<!---
Name: Jessica Kang
-->
This is how I make Chapaguri aka Ramdon, which was featured in the movie Parasite. 
Feeds about two hungry college students.


### Ingredients
- 2 packages of Chapagetti
- 1 package of Neoguri
  You can probably find these at any asian supermarket


### Instructions
1. Boil water in a pot, about 5 cups or more
2. Put in all three noodles and cook for 5 minutes
3. Drain water from the pot. Leave a little water to mix the noodles
4. Add the oil and soupbase packets from the Chapagetti packages and half of the soupbase from Neoguri (Adding the vegetable packets are optional. I personally don't)
5. Mix while the pot is on simmer
6. Enjoy!


Enjoy!
