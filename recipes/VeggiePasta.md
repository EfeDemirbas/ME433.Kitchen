## Shan's Veggie Pasta
This is my go to meal while under quarantine since its simple to make and very versatile when it comes to seasoning. The following ingredients is what I typically use, but I do sometimes change it up a bit depending on what I'm in the mood for. 

### Ingredients
- 1 box of penne pasta
- 1 jar of marina sauce
- 1/2 lb of mushrooms
- 1/2 lb of bell peppers
- salt and pepper
- olive oil
- 1 tablespoon of onion and garlic powder
- 1 teaspoon of chili powder
- 2 cups of mozzarella cheese

### Instructions
1. Boil 4 quarts of water in a pan. Add penne pasta to boiling water and cook for 7 minutes. 
2. Chop mushrooms and bell pepper into smaller bite size pieces and add to a seperate pan with olive oil. Cook until vegetables turn to a crispy light brown. 
3. Add vegetables to pasta and add all the seasoning listed in the ingredients. Mix throughly.  
4. Add pasta into a aluminum tray and sprinkle mozzarella cheese. Place in oven heated to 350 degrees (farenheit) and bake for 10 min (or until cheese is melted).

Enjoy!
