![Yummy!](https://assets.epicurious.com/photos/57a105e9437fcffe02f7235d/6:4/w_620%2Ch_413/penne-in-cream-sauce-with-sausage.jpg)

Total comfort food pasta. It's creamy and savory and delicious - the best one-pot pasta. Side with a light caeser salad and some garlic bread and you've got yourself a meal!

### Ingredients
- 1 tablespoon butter
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 1 medium onion, thinly sliced
- 3 garlic cloves, minced
- 1 pound sweet Italian sausage, casings removed
- 2/3 cup dry white wine
- 1 14 1/2-ounce can diced peeled tomatoes with juices
- 1 cup whipping cream
- 6 tablespoons chopped Italian parsley
- 1 pound penne pasta
- 1 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese

### Instructions
1. Melt butter with oil in heavy large skillet over medium-high heat.
2. Add onion and garlic and sauté until golden brown and tender.
3. Add sausage and sauté until golden brown and cooked through, breaking up with back of spoon. Drain any excess drippings from the skillet. 
4. Add wine to skillet and boil until almost all liquid evaporates, about 2 minutes.
5. Add tomatoes with juices and simmer for 3 minutes.
6. Add cream and simmer until sauce thickens slightly, about 5 minutes.
7. Stir in 4 tablespoons parsley.
8. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Remove from heat. (Sauce can be prepared 1 day ahead. Cover and refrigerate.)
9. Cook pasta in large pot of boiling salted water until tender but still firm to bite; drain.
10. Bring sauce to simmer.
11. Pour sauce over pasta and add 3/4 cup cheese and toss to coat. Sprinkle with remaining 1/4 cup cheese and 2 tablespoons parsley.  

Bon Apétit!
