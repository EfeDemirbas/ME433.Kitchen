## Evan Johns Recipe Confetti Bars

Growing up, my sister often made these confetti bars for my family. They were definitely one of our favorite desserts (along with her famous carmelitas).


### Instructions
½ cup peanut butter smooth
¼ cup butter
1 package (10 oz) butterscotch chips
1 bag (10 oz size) miniature marshmallows coloured/flavoured variety

### Instructions
1. Cream butter and sugars together.
2. Mix until smooth, creamy, and light.
3. Add one egg, one egg yolk, and vanilla extract. Discard the whites of the one egg or use them in this egg wrap recipe.
4. Add dry ingredients.
5. Mix until a thick dough forms and then add in the white chocolate chips.
6. Stir the chips in to finish the Confetti Bars dough.
7. Press dough into a parchment paper-lined 9×13-inch pan.
8. Bake until no longer glossy on top and lightly browned at the edges.
9. (Process photos shown below:) Add marshmallows immediately after removing from the oven, and then return to the oven for 1 and 1/2 minutes.
10. Remove from the oven, sprinkle on M&M’s, white chocolate chips, and finally sprinkles. Let Confetti Bars sit until firm before cutting.
