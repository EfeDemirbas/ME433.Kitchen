This dish, which translates to "Grilled Tuna with Breadcrumbs", is typical of the coastal regions of Italy. It's a light dish that pairs excellently with a simple salad.

## Ingredients
* **2 tuna steaks**, 200g each
* **salt** and freshly ground **black pepper**
* **lemon juice**
* 100g **breadcrumbs**
* 2 **garlic cloves**, crushed
* 2 tbsp **parsley**, finely chopped
* 3 tbsp **olive oil**

## Recipe
1. Preheat a grill (though a pan will suffice).
2. Mix the breadcrumbs, garlic, parsley, and olive oil together in a bowl obtaining a dry mixture. If the mix is too wet, add more breadcrumbs.
3. Season the tuna steaks with the salt and pepper.
4. Dip the tuna steaks into the breadcrumb mixture, making sure that each side is well coated.
5. Squeeze over the lemon juice.
6. Cook on the grill/pan for 3-4 minutes a side, until the breadcrumbs are brown and crispy.
