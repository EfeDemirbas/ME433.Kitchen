## Bohan's Perfect Instant Ramen
You might think that instant ramen is easy to make. That might be true, but there is a certain art to making it WELL.

### Ingredients
- 2 packs of instant ramen - your choice of brand/flavor!
- OPTIONAL: 1 egg
- OPTIONAL: 4 cheddar cheese sheets
- OPTIONAL: 1 stalk green onion

### Instructions
1. Unpack the noodles and soup flavor packs and put in a large microwaveable bowl. Microwaving gives a much better and controllable range of textures than the traditional boiling.
2. Fill with water until water reaches about halfway up the top block of noodles.
3. Set the microwave for 10 minutes.
4. At precisely 7:30 left on the timer, open and stir the best you can. You may want to turn over the top block to submerge the other half in water. Keep microwaving.
5. At precisely 4:45 left on the timer, open and break the blocks by stirring. They should be soft enough to do so. Keep microwaving.
6. At precisely 2:30 left on the timer, open and crack the egg in. This time may be changed based on how cooked you like your egg. Stir thoroughly if you prefer it to be mixed with the soup. If you chose not to have an egg, simply stir at this time.
7. After it has finished, place the cheese sheets on top of the noodles. Cover the lid and wait until the cheese melts.
8. Finally, chop and sprinkle the green onions on top.

You can add any additional toppings you wish - popular ones are typically lettuce, sliced beef/pork, seaweed, and mushrooms.
If you like your noodles harder/softer, adjust the time in the microwave PROPORTIONALLY, including the stir times.

Enjoy!
