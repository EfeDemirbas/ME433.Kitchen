## Salt-Pepper Shrimps
This is a famous dish in Cantonese cuisine with super crispy texture and a tantalizing aroma of pepper and salt. Do not miss it if you are a seafood lover!

### Ingredients
- 1 lb shrimps (fresh ones recommended)
- 2/3 oz ginger root, chopped
- 4-5 garlic cloves, chopped
- halves of red and green bell peppers, diced
- half an onion, diced
- 2 scallions, chopped
- 2 teaspoons Cantonese cooking wine
- 2 cups oil
- 1 teaspoon potato starch
- 1 teaspoon salt-pepper

If you don't have salt-pepper, it's easy to prepare some with the following ingredients:
- 1/2 cup salt
- 1 star anise (seeds removed)
- 10 red chill peppers
- 1/4 oz white peppers

Just stir-roast the mixture for 10 minutes and finely grind it.

### Instructions
1. Boil the shrimps until cooked. Add the cooking wine midway to remove the fishy taste.
1. Take the shrimps out and mix them with potato starch.
1. Heat the oil up to 350°F. Deep-fry the shrimps for 2 minutes.
1. Take the shrimps out. Heat the oil to 400°F and deep-fry the shrimps again for 30 seconds.
1. Stir-fry all pre-cut ingredients (ginger, garlic, bell peppers, onion and scallions) in a pan until the aroma comes out.
1. Add fried shrimps and salt-pepper. Stir-fry for a bit to mix them together before the dish is ready to serve.
1. Enjoy it!
