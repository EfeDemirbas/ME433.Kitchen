My girlfriend found this recipe about a year ago and we've probably made it 20 times since. It's delicious, filling, and very easy to make - perfect for a student with limited time for cooking. You can also swap the shrimp for chicken breast to make it cheaper!

### Ingredients
- 1 pound pasta (long noodles like spaghetti or linguine work very well)
- 3 tablespoons butter
- 1/4 cup yellow onion, diced
- 1 bunch asparagus, trimmed and cut diagonally into 1-inch pieces
- 1 pound medium shrimp, peeled and deveined
- Salt to taste
- Black pepper to taste
- Slap Ya Mama Cajun seasoning, to taste
- 1 10-ounce can Ro-Tel diced tomatoes & green chiles
- 1/2 cup half-and-half
- Parmesan cheese, to serve

*Makes 4-6 servings*

### Instructions
1. Cook pasta according to package instructions, drain, and set aside.
2. Place a skillet over medium heat and melt butter.
3. Add onion and saute for 2 minutes.
4. Add asparagus and saute for 3 minutes.
5. Add shrimp and cook for 4 minutes.
6. Season with salt, pepper, and Cajun seasoning. <br>
    - Note: The Cajun seasoning has A TON of flavor. If you're not a big fan of spicy food, add a little at a time until you're at the spice level you want.
7. Pour in Ro-Tel and half-and-half and simmer  over low heat for 5 minutes.
8. Remove from heat and add pasta. Stir/toss to coat pasta evenly.
9. Sprinkle with Parmesan cheese and serve.
