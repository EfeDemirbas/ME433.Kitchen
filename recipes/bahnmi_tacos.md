# Bahn Mi Tacos
Cooking time ~6 hrs

## Ingredients

- ~2lbs pork shoulder or leg roast
- 3 tbsp brown sugar
- 2 tbsp soy sauce
- 2 tbsp Chinese 5 spice
- 1/4 cup stock or water

- red cabbage, sliced/shredded
- 3-4 large carrots, grated
- 1 large cucumber, sliced
- jalapeños, sliced
- 1-2 limes, quartered
- 3 tbsp vinegar
- 3 tbsp mirin
- corn tortillas
- cooking oil
- cilantro

## Instructions

### Roast
Massage the pork with the five spice, brown sugar and a generous sprinkle of salt. Be sure to cover the entire surface area as thoroughly as possible.

Place pork in slow cooker and cover with soy sauce and ginger ale. If your slow cooker runs hotter then you might want to add another 1/4 cup of stock/water

Cook on low for ~6 hours or until pork shreds easily with a fork. Shred and allow to soak up the cooking juices

### Vegetables
Combine shredded cabbage, carrot and cucumber slices with vinegar and mirin. This can basically be mixed up and left in the fridge for a good few days as the vinegar acts to preserve the salad.

### Tortillas
Add ~1 tbsp cooking oil to pan, heat until warm. Place 2 stacked tortillas in pan, allowing the tortillas to soak oil. Cook until browned, flip, cook until browned.

Serve with meat and vegetable mix, top with jalapeños, cilantro, and squeezed lime to taste.
