These chocolate chocolate cookies have a melted marshmallow interior and pair perfectly with a glass of milk. Make sure you plce your marshmalllows in the freezer and you have softened butter before baking. Makes roughly 40 cookies.

### Ingredients
- 3 cups all-purpose flour
- 2/3 cup cocoa powder
- 1 teaspoon baking soda
- 1/2 cup cane sugar
- 1/2 cup brown sugar
- 1/2 cup softened salted butter
- 2 large eggs
- 2 teaspoons vanilla extract
- 8 oz semisweet chocolate chips
- 8 oz frozen mini marshmallows

### Instructions
1. Preheat oven to 400F.
2. Combine the dry ingredients (flour, cocoa powder, baking soda) in a medium bowl and set aside.
3. Combine the sugars (cane and brown) in a large bowl.
4. Beat the softened butter into the bowl with the sugars (an electric mixer is very helpful).
5. Add the eggs and vanilla into the butter sugar mixture and beat until light and fluffy.
6. Now add the dry ingredients and chocolate chips into the larger bowl (blend at a low speed until combined). The batter will be stiff.
7. Take a large spoonful of dough and flatten into a circle in the palm of your hand. Take 4-5 frozen mini marshmallows and place them in the center and wrap them in the dough and roll into a sphere. Make sure you are only taking a few marshmallows out at a time so they don't thaw.
8. Place the cookies two inches apart on a tray and bake for 8-10 minutes.
9. Transfer the cookies to a cooling rack.

Enjoy!
