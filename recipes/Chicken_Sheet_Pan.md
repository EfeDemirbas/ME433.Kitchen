A batch of vegetarian chilli, serve with sour cream, lime wedges and tortillas! 

### Ingredients
- Chicken thighs
- Olive oil
- Cauliflower
- Shallots
- Garlic cloves
- Salt

### Instructions
1. Coat the chicken thighs and cauliflower florets with some za’atar, salt and olive oil. Toss with a few shallots and spread it all out on a sheet pan.
2. Bake! Now you get to chill for 30 minutes.
3. While the chicken bakes, whisk together some za’atar oil—basically just oil, garlic, za’atar and salt.
4. When the chicken thighs reach an internal temperature of 165°, they’re done! Pull them out of the oven.
5. Drizzle with za’atar oil to finish, and then dig in.
