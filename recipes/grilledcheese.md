## Aaron's grilled cheese sandwich
<!---
Name: Aaron-Patrick Empedrado
-->
I really like cheese and I really like bread so when I have both of them, I like to make grilled cheese. Makes 1 sandwich.

### Ingredients
- 2 slices of white bread (not whole wheat)
- 2 slices of cheddar cheese
- 1 ounce of grated mozzarella cheese
- 1 tablespoon butter

### Instructions
1. Heat up a non-stick pan on medium heat.
2. Place butter onto the pan.
3. When the butter is fully melted, tilt the pan to cover most of the surface and then place the 2 slices of bread onto the pan.
4. Place 1 slice of cheddar cheese on each piece of bread.
5. Sprinkle the grated mozzarella on one piece of bread.
6. Use some sort of utensil (spoon, fork, knife, spatula, etc.) to peak under the other piece of bread until it is golden.
7. Once the bread is golden, place the non-mozzarella bread slice onto the other and press it down with a spatula or your hand for 20 seconds.
8. Slide the grilled cheese off of the pan and onto a plate then cut it in half **diagonally**.

Enjoy!
