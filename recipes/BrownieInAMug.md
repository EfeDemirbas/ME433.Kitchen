# Ben's Recipe for Brownie in a Mug
I love brownies and I'm very lazy, so here's a great recipe to enjoy brownies within 5 minutes.
Makes 1 brownie.

## Ingredients
- 1/4 cup flour (30 g)
- 1/4 cup sugar (50 g)
- 2 Tbsp (13 g) cocoa (natural, unsweetened)
- Pinch of salt
- Tiny pinch of cinnamon
- 1/4 cup water (60 ml)
- 2 Tbsp canola oil, vegetable oil, or melted butter
- 1/8 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 1 small scoop of ice cream or 1 or 2 teaspoons heavy whipping cream to serve

## Instructions
1. Add the dry ingredients to the mug and stir: Place flour, sugar, cocoa, salt, and cinnamon in a microwave safe ceramic mug. Stir with a fork or spoon to mix well and break up any clumps.
2. Add the wet ingredients and stir: Add the oil, water, and vanilla to the cup and stir until the mixture is smooth and there are no lumps.
3. Zap in microwave: Place in microwave and heat on high until the mixture is cooked through, about a 1 minute and 40 seconds for a 1000 watt microwave, or 1 minute 10 seconds on a 1650 watt microwave.
4. Top with ice cream! Let cool for a minute and serve with a scoop of vanilla ice cream or a teaspoon or two of whipping cream poured over.
