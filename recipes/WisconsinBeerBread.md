Here's a favorite recipe of my aunt; it's really easy to bake and delightfully delicious!

### Ingredients
- 3 cups of **self-rising** flour
- 1/2 cup of sugar
- 2 tbsp of melted butter
- 12 oz of your favorite _Wisconsin_ beer (it won't taste as good if it's not Wisconsin!)

### Instructions
1. Mix ingredients in a larger-than-average bowl.
2. Preheat your oven to **375F**.
3. Grease your favorite loaf (or whichever form you prefer!) pan, and pour the ingredients into it.
4. Bake for 1 hour.  **It's _that_ easy!**

# Devour to your heart's content!
