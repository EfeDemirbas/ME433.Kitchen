One of my favorite dishes that my mom makes is a meat pie baked with beef, chicken
and potatoes. I will be sharing a meat pie recipe I found online that is pretty
similar to the one she makes. It's simple to make and doesn't require much.

### Ingredients
- beef (ground beef also works) - 400 grams
- Chicken breast - 1 piece
- Potato (large) - 1 piece
- large eggs - 2 pieces
- onions - 2 pieces
- butter - 100 grams
- flour - 300 grams
- sour cream - 200 milliters
- baking powder - 2 teaspoons
- Salt
- Black pepper

### Instructions
1. warm up the butter in a bowl. Add the sour cream and 1 egg. Add some salt and
mix it around.
2. Sift the flour and baking powder into the mixture. Make the dough so it's soft and
elastic.
3. Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and place it in the fridge.
4. Dice the chicken breast into small pieces. (If using beef, also dice it into
small pieces).
5. Peel and dice the potato into small pieces.
6. Dice the onions into small pieces.
7. Now, mix the chicken breast, beef (or ground beef), potatoes, onion. Add some
salt and black pepper and mix it together.
8. Take the dough out of the fridge and split it into two uneven parts. One should be
only slightly bigger. Place the larger piece on top of parchment paper and roll
it out into an oval shape. Do the same thing with the smaller piece. Try to get it
to the same shape and size as the bigger piece.
9. Spread the filling onto the bigger piece of flat dough and place the smaller sheet
of dough on top of the filling. Curl up the edges. Using a fork, create small holes
on top of the pie for ventilation.
10. Mix the remaining egg and use it to coat the dough using a brush.
11. Bake it for 40 minutes at 180Â°C.

That's it! Let it cool down a little. Cut it into even pieces and share it with
your friends and family.
