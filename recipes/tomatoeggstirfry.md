## Ruotong's Yummy Tomato & Egg Stir Fry 

This is one of THE healthiest vegetarian dish that combines flavour and nutritional values. 
In China, its name is well-known. 

### Ingredients 
- 3 ripe tomatoes
- 3 eggs
- 3 cloves garlic, sliced
- 2 tablespoons + 1 teaspoon cooking oil
- 1 tablespoon water
- 1/4 teaspoon salt
- 1 pinch sugar
- 1 tbsp chopped spring onion, for garnishing, optional

### Instructions
1. Peel off the skin of the tomatoes (see note). Then cut them into small chunks.
2. Beat the eggs with 1 tablespoon of water.
3. Heat 2 tablespoons of oil in a wok (or a frying pan) on high heat. Pour in eggs when oil smokes. When the edge is cooked, push to one side to let uncooked part touch the bottom of the wok. Take the egg out as soon as there is no more liquid (do not overcook).
4. Put 1 teaspoon of oil to the same wok, cook tomato and garlic on medium heat until tomato is a little mushy.
5. Add cooked egg. Roughly break up the egg with the end of a spatula. Sprinkle salt and sugar, then give everything a quick stir.
6. Garnish with spring onion before serving if you wish.

Enjoy!
