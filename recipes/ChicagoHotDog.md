## Chicago Style Vienna Hot Dogs
I love Chicago hot dogs, and since moving to the Chicago area, I've started making Chicago hot dogs all the time! (Makes 1 dog)

### Ingredients
- 1 Vienna Hot Dog
- 1 Poppy Seed Bun
- 1 Vienna Pickle Spear
- 1 Tomato
- 1 Yellow Onion
- 2 Vienna Sport Peppers
- Yellow Mustard
- Vienna Green Chicago Style Relish
- Celery Salt


### Instructions
1. Dice yellow onion
2. Cut 2, 1/4 inch tomato wedges
3. Begin boiling water on stove at medium temperature
4. Once boiling, place hot dog in the water for 2 minutes to cook
5. With 30 seconds left, place the bun in a strainer above boiling 
   water so that the steam softens the bun. Place a lid over the 
   strainer and make sure no water can jump up onto the bun and make it soggy.
6. Place hot dog into bun on a plate
7. Squiggle of yellow mustard on the dog
8. Tuck a pickle into the bun on one side of the dog, 2 sport peppers on the other side, and the tomato wedges in between.
9. Scoop some green relish and onions on top of the dog. 
10. Sprinkle some celery salt on top and enjoy!
