A local favorite sold by the pound at our high school fundraiser and made with love by my part-Portuguese papa. Good for the cold winter months. Yields 10 servings for all da hanabaddah homies.

### Ingredients
- 1 lb ham hock, cooked and shredded<br />
&emsp;&emsp;- Ensure to keep some fat on the meat!
- Broth (from cooking ham hock)
- 1 lb Portuguese sausage, cubed
- 1 tbsp shoyu (soy sauce)
- 1 tbsp Hawaiian salt
- 4 tsp granulated garlic
- 1 can (16 oz) whole peeled tomatoes
- 1 can (16 oz) refried beans
- 3 large carrots, diced
- 1 medium onion, chopped
- 1 cup celery, diced
- 1 can (15 oz) kidney beans
- 2 large potatoes, cubed
- 1 cup macaroni (uncooked)
- 1 medium head cabbage, cubed

### Instructions
1. Boil ham hocks in 2 quarts of water until tender. Reserve broth. Shred meat and discard bones.<br />
&emsp;&emsp;Note: can cook the day before and shred, saving the broth
2. Put shredded ham hock and Portuguese sausage in a (really big) pot on medium heat. Add enough ham hock broth to just cover the meat and bring it all to a soft boil.<br />
&emsp;&emsp;Note: if there is not enough broth, add a mix of water and beef stock to taste.
3. Add seasonings to pot mixture (shoyu, Hawaiian salt, and granulated garlic). Also add tomatoes and refried beans and bring it all to a soft boil.
4. Add carrots, onion, celery, and kidney beans. Let it cook at a soft boil until the carrots are soft.
5. Add potatoes and macaroni. Cook until the potatoes are soft and macaroni is just cooked. Add the cabbage last and let it simmer for 5 to 10 minutes until soft.
6. Enjoy!
