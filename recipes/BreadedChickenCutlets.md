### Ingredients
- 1/2 cup milk (or buttermilk)
- 3 tablespoons soy sauce
- 1 teaspoon garlic powder
- 1/4 teaspoon pepper
- 1 boneless skinless chicken breast
- Vegetable oil
- Italian style bread crumbs


### Instructions
1. Cut chicken breast into thin horizontal slices no more than 1/2 inch thick. (A single chicken breast can be cut into 3 or slices.)
2. Marinate slices in mix of milk, soy sauce, garlic powder, and pepper.
3. Let marinate sit for 10-15 minutes.
4. Heat stove to medium heat.
5. Coat pan with just enough vegetable oil to prevent sticking.
6. For each chicken slice, coat both sides with bread crumbs and put into heated pan.
7. Cook each side for 3-4 minutes, using fork to flip sides, and watching to make sure it doesn't burn. Cover with lid to ensure inside cooks thoroughly especially if slices are thicker.

Enjoy!
