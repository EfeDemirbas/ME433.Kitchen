A delicious dessert which will ruin your waistline but is more tempting than aphrodite herself..

### Ingredients
- 2 scoops vanilla ice cream
- 1 banana cut into pieces
- 3 tbsp Cashew and Pistacio nuts ground into little pieces
- Optional chocolate sauce
- 1-2 wafer crackers
- 1-2 Cherries

### Instructions
1. Place cut bananas into an open metal vessel and place in a bigger vessel filled with water. Boil the water in the bigger vessel for about 5-7 minutes. This will heat the bananas and release the aroma.
2. Remove ice cream from the refrigerator and let it warm up for a few minutes at the room temperature. The idea is to avoid placing freezing ice cream on top of the warm bananas.
3. Place the cut bananas on the bottom of the ice cream cup. Leave 3-4 pieces for the top. 
4. Add a layer of wafer crackers on top of it.
5. Place two scoops of ice cream in the bowl.
6. Arrange the remaining banana slices on the sides.
7. Sprinkle the dryfruits on top.
8. Add little chocolate sauce. Chocolate has a very strong flavour and can mask the banana and vanilla combo.
9. If making for a loved one, top off with a delightful cherry.

Enjoy!
