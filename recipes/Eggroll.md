# Alyssa's Egg Roll 
This is a recipe made by my dad that I've been trying to replicate. Haven't quite gotten there yet, 
but I do make them for my friends at parties.

- 2 oz dried lily flower 
- 1.25 oz dried black fungus strips
- 3-4 oz dried shitake mushrooms
- 2 squares of baked tofu
- 1 lb pork loin strips (if you can't find pre cut pork strips I get 1/4 in cut pork lion chops and cut slice them into strips)

- 1 tbs corstarch
- 1/4 tsp baking soda
- soysauce
- salt
- cooking oil

1.5 If you couldn't find the pork stips cut the pork loins into 1/4 in thick slices.  	
2. Marinate the pork strips in the sugar, cornstarch, baking soda, 1 tbs of soysauce, and salt overnight.
3. When the everything is finished soaking, drain all the soaked ingredients and squeeze dry.
4. Cut the shitake mushrooms in slices.
5. Cut the baked tofu in 3rds parallel to the square face and then into thin strips.

#### Making the Filling
1. Stir fry the bamboo, lily flower, fungus strips, shitake mushrooms, and baked tofu in tbs of oil adding salt and setting aside.
2. Stir fry the pork with 2 tbs of oil till cooked.
3. Mix in the stir-fried veggies and bean sprouts and turn heat off.
4. Put mixture strainer with bowl under to drain juices and refrigerate for 30 min to 1 hr.

#### Assembling and Cooking 
1. Take the filling out of the fridge along with the egg roll skins.
2. Crack and beat an egg in to a small bowl.
3. Heat up a pot of oil to 375 to prep for frying.
3. Take one of the skins and place it in a diamond shape in front of you.
4. Take some filling and put it parrallel to your body near the corner closest to you.
5. Roll the skin up and fold in the sides (kind of like rolling up a burrito).
6. Right before you completly roll it up, take some egg and spread it on the remaining unrolled area and then finish rolling it up.
7. Deep fry 2-3 egg rolls at a time until golden brown.    

Enjoy with a side of Chinkiang Vinigar mixed with the drained juices from the filling!
