## Spicy Fruit Kompot
This is a variation on the traditional Polish kompot (a drink made from dried fruit), though using fresh / frozen ingredients, with a little bit of a kick, perfect for cold Chicago winters.

### Ingredients
* 350g white seedless grapes
* 350g frozen berries
* 350ml apple juice
* 350ml water
* 1 dried chili 

### Instructions
1. Slice the grapes in half
2. Slice the dried chili into 2mm strips, removing half of the seeds (the more seeds you leave behind, the spicier the kompot, so its always better to start with fewer chilis / seeds and add more to personal preference.
3. Combine all of the ingredients together in a medium (~3 quart) pot, and cover with lid.
4. Simmer on medium heat for 30 minutes, until the fruit has completely softened. 
5. Serve warm and enjoy!
