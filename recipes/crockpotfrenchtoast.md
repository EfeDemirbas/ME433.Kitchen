My fellow MS Robotics students and I essentially live in the Center for Robotics and Biosystems, so I figured slow cooking meals for the group would boost everyone's morale. This recipe is one of the more successful dishes.

### Ingredients (serves 6)
- Cooking spray, for Crock-Pot
- 1 large brioche (or challah), preferably day-old
- 8 large eggs
- 2 c. half-and-half
- 1/3 c. granulated sugar
- 1 tsp. pure vanilla extract
- 1/2 tsp. ground cinnamon
- 1/4 tsp. kosher salt
- small pinch nutmeg
- Maple syrup, for serving
- Powdered sugar, for serving

### Instructions
1. Lightly grease the inside of Crock-Pot with cooking spray. Slice brioche into thick slices then quarter each slice. Place bread in Crock-Pot.
2. In a large bowl, combine eggs, half-and-half, sugar, ½ teaspoon cinnamon, vanilla, salt and nutmeg and beat until well combined. Pour egg mixture over bread, folding bread gently to make sure each piece is coated.
3. Cook on low for 2 ½ to 3 hours, until the French toast is warm and cooked through.
4. Serve warm with maple syrup and powdered sugar.

Enjoy!
