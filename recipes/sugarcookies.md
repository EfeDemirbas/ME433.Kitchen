I might have a mild sugar addiction and this is what I do when a need a quick fix. Enjoy

- 1 and 1/2 teaspoon baking powder
- 1/4 teaspoon salt
- 1/2 cup unsalted butter
- 3/4 cup granulated sugar
- 1 large egg
- 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract
- 1/2 cup sprinkles


### Instructions
1. Whisk the flour, baking powder, and salt together in a medium bowl. Set aside.
2. Beat the butter and granulated sugar together on medium-high speed until creamed, about 1 minute.
3. Add the egg and vanilla extract and beat on high speed until combined, about 1 minute.
4. Add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients and mix on low until combined.
5. Beat in 1/2 cup of sprinkles.
6. Scoop large sections of dough (about 2 Tablespoons of dough each) and roll into balls.
7. Cover and chill the cookie dough balls in the refrigerator for at least 2 hours (and up to 4 days).
8. Preheat oven to 350°F (177°C). Line baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone baking mats. Set aside.
