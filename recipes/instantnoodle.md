I am a lazy person, so this instant noodles recipe helps filling in something in my stomach instantly.

### Ingredients
- a packet of instant noodles you can easily get from any places like 7-11.

### appliances and utensils
- a bowl(some of the instant noodles doesn't come with a bowl)
- a pair of chopsticks(if you want to do it chinese-style)
- a instant boiling kettle(a must-have for me to get the water boiled as quickly as possible, but if you want to have a tender taste, you can cook you noodles in a pot or wok, this is just what I prefer)
- a lid that can cover the top of the bowl(to make the noodles softer)

### Instructions
1. Start to get water boiled in the electric boiling kettle.
2. Put the noodles and all the stuff in small ingredient packets into the bowl, and wait for the water to finish.
3. Once the water is boiled, add the water in the bowl up until it floats the noodle chunk, then put the lid on the top of the bowl.
4. Wait for 5 minutes.

Enjoy!
