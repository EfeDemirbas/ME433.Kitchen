I am goig to put down receipe for an Indian egg curry. 
This is my usual go to curry for having with Chappathis/ Paranthas every night

### Ingredients (serves 4-5)
1. 5 eggs
2. 2 Onions
3. 2 Tomatos
4. quarter packet of Mushrooms (Optinal)
5. 3 to 4 strips of Chicken breat (Optional)
6. Egg Masala Currry (I prefer an Indian brand called Sakthi)

### Instructions
1. Chop Onion and add them into oil for about 5 minutes and roast them. You 
   should do this until Onion turns golden
2. Add the chopped Tomatos. Heat and stir until the raw tomato seems cooked (it
   shrinks and is not too fleshy at the point its cooked)
3. Add the mushrooms (if you like/ want) into the mix and cook for a while
3. Break the eggs and stir them with required Chilli powder, Salt and Pepper ( Green
   Chillies will set up a more spicy curry), Stir unitl the yolks nicely blends into
   the white fluid.
4. Add the eggs to the onions and tomatos and keep stirring them. Failure to stir during this
   process will reuslt in an omlete (lol!). Keep stirring so that eggs breaks up and 
   you have a nice mesh
5. Once you feel, eggs are cooked, mix the egg masala into water (as per the masala instructions).
   Usually its 1:2 (for every cup of masla there should be 2 cups of water). Make sure you
   add 2-3 cups of masala-water mixture (to the point until all your vegetables and egss 
   are fully immersed in masala water)
6. Add chooped down pieces of chicken breat if you like
7. Stir and let it cook for 5-10 minutes. Your egg curry should be ready

Goes well with Chapathis / Paranthas. But if you like to spice up your rice,
it does go well with rice as well
