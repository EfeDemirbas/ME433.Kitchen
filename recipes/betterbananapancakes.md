## Banana Pancakes
Crowd pleasing banana pancakes make from scratch. A fun twist on ordinary pancakes.

### Ingredients (6 servings)
- 1 cup all-purpose flour
- 1 tbsp. white sugar
- 2 tsp. baking powder
- 1/4 tsp. salt
- 1 egg, beaten
- 1 cup milk
- 2 tbsp. vegetable oil
- 2 ripe bananas, mashed

### Procedure
1. Combine flour, white sugar, baking powder, and salt. In a separate bowl mix together egg, milk, vegetable oil, and bananas.

2. Stir flour mixture into banana mixture; batter will be slightly lumpy.
