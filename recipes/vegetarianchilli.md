A batch of vegetarian chilli, serve with sour cream, lime wedges and tortillas! 

### Ingredients
- 3 dried California Chiles
- 3 dried Arbol Chiles
- 2 dried Guajillo Chiles
- 2 dried Pasilla Chiles
- 1 habanero pepper
- 8 cloves of garlic
- 1 large white onion
- 4 Bay Leaves
- 1 tsp ground cumin
- 1 tsp ground black pepper, or an equivalent amount of black peppercorns
- Olive oil
- 3 cups of vegetable broth
- 1 can tomatoes, or an equivalent amount of fresh tomatoes
- Salt to taste
- 2 large sweet potatoes
- 1 cup of white quinoa
- 1 can of black beans
- Baby spinach (optional) as preferred
- Your cheese of choice (I prefer a mix of Jack and Mozzarella)

### Instructions
1. Rehydrate the dried chiles in hot water for about 30 minutes (remove the seeds if you don't want it to be too spicy but I like the kick!). You'll know they're done once the colors start becoming very vibrant!
2. Cut the onion into large portions and remove the garlic cloves skin. Drizzle olive oil over onions and garlic and broil/grill until a nice layer of char is formed on the outer layer. 
3. Blend the chiles, onions, garlic, spices, half a cup of vegetable stock and all the spices until the texture is smooth (or to your liking!). Add salt to taste.
4. Transfer to a saucepan and simmer along with the rest of the sauce and the tomatoes for about an hour. You can also blend the tomatoes in the previous steps but I like to break them down later for some tomato chunks!
5. This above is your sauce, and you can use it as a salsa for anything else as well! 
6. While the sauce is simmering, chop up sweet potatoes into bite sized cubes. Leave the peels on!
7. Boil Sweet potatoes for 10 minutes (you don't want them too tender since we are going to simmer them with the sauce after and we don't want them turning into mush).
8. Boil the quinoa separately till cooked.
9. Add the sweet potatoes, quinoa to the sauce and simmer for approximately 30 minutes! Test the sweet potatoes for tenderness with a fork - if a fork pierces them smoothly, they're ready!
10. Stir in a can of drained black beans and spinach (let the spinach reduce slightly before serving), and serve while it's hot! Sprinkle the cheese over and garnish with some flaky salt as well!

Enjoy!
