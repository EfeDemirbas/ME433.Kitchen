Makes 4 Stuffed Peppers – This is what the recipe says, but it typically makes 5 of them.
Note: Drew typically substitutes the kidney or white beans for 1/2lb cooked ground turkey. Seasoned to taste.

### Ingredients
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 1/2 onion, chopped
- 2 ribs celery, chopped
- 1 carrot, chopped
- 3 to 4 cloves of garlic, minced
- 2 teaspoons dried thyme
- 1 1/2 teaspoons dried oregano
- 1 cup pearled barley
- 1 tomato, chopped (about ½ cup)
- 2 tablespoons sherry vinegar or red wine vinegar
- 2 cups vegetable broth
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 1/4 teaspoon ground pepper
- 4 bell peppers, whatever color you find is cool
- 1 1/2 cups cooked kidney or white beans
- 1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley


### Instructions
1.	In a medium pot, heat the oil over medium heat. Add the onion and cook until it starts turning golden, about 3 minutes. Add the celery, carrot, garlic, thyme, and oregano and cook for another 2 minutes. Throw in the barley, tomato, and vinegar and stir. Add the broth, salt, and pepper and let it come to a low simmer. Cook, uncovered, until all the broth is absorbed and the barley is tender, about 15 minutes.

2.	While the barley is simmering, heat your oven to 375°F. Cut the tops off the bell peppers and scrape out any seeds. Place them in an oiled pie plate or loaf pan.

3.	When the barley is done, fold in the beans and turn off the heat. (This filling can even be made a day or two ahead of time). Fill the bell peppers up to the top with the filling, cover them tightly with foil, and bake until the peppers are tender, 45 minutes to 1 hour. Let them rest for 5 minutes after coming out of the oven. Top with the parsley and serve.

Enjoy!
